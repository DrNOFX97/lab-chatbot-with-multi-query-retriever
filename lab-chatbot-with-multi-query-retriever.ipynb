      "The Intellectual Property Policy may impact the collaboration with external partners and the integration of their innovations in several ways. Firstly, the policy establishes guidelines and procedures for the ownership, protection, and utilization of intellectual property generated by employees during their employment. This means that any intellectual property created, conceived, or developed by employees during company time or using company resources, equipment, or facilities will be considered the property of the company. This may affect the ability of external partners to collaborate with employees on projects that involve the creation of intellectual property, as the ownership of the resulting intellectual property may be subject to the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the policy states that the company has the right to protect, license, and commercialize any intellectual property owned by the company as it deems appropriate. This means that if external partners contribute to the creation of intellectual property, the company may have the right to license or commercialize it without the consent of the external partners. This could potentially impact the willingness of external partners to collaborate with the company, as they may not have control over the use and distribution of their innovations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the policy requires employees to maintain the confidentiality of any intellectual property owned by the company and not disclose it to any third parties without the express written consent of an authorized representative of the company. This\n",
